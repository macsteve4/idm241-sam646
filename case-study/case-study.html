                    <h2>The Overview</h2>

<p>In my IDM-241 class, our project goal was to create or improve micro-interactions. There were three phases to be built out– an alpha, beta, and final. My personal goals followed creating something that was well-received with users, and self-fulfilling for myself. I created interactions that would be built to improve my website. The first was an animated logo, and the second two were iterations of an interactive image. The project turned out to be a success, and it even led me to learn more about the coding community. </p>





<h2>The Challenge</h2>

<p>This class focused on micro-interactions. The goal was either to create them, or to improve pre-existing ones that we had found online. Regardless of what route we took, our professor encouraged us to draw from examples we saw on other websites, as well as citing pre-existing code to help ourselves when building.
<br>
<br>
There were three phases of interactions that we built out. An alpha, beta, and final, all increasing in complexity. Our timeline for the entirety of the project was about 9 weeks, with each of the three phases having deliverables every other week or so.
<br>
<br>
This project was a solo venture, and the purpose was for us as UI/UX students to gain experience with ideating and creating meaningful/ enjoyable micro-interactions. More importantly, it was also for us to know/learn what made for a truly engaging interaction.
<br>
<br>
When starting out, my goal was to make a project that I truly felt was meaningful, professional, and ultimately something that could be portfolio material. I additionally wanted my final product to be well-received by potential users. I needed to ensure that I had substantial material that I could build off of, to be able to really create something great. </p>


<h2>The Process</h2>

<p>I began to look at where I could take these interactions. I had so many ideas, but I didn’t know where to start. One night, while adding content to my personal portfolio website for CO-OP interviews, I had the idea to create micro-interactions for use on it. It solved the problem of finding something meaningful– as my website’s appearance is very important to me.
<br>
<br>
For the simple first (alpha) phase, I decided to improve the logo on my portfolio website. I wanted to take the opportunity to make it animated. Since my website showcases my projects and artistic creativity, having an animated logo would help to really give it character. My idea was to have my logo move while the user would hover their mouse over it. Below is a GIF that I built out in Adobe After Effects, of what I wanted to achieve in the build. </p>

<br>
<br>

<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<p>I added a :hover CSS selector so that the pre-existing PNG file would change to a looping GIF. This would give the illusion that the logo would be moving when the user moused over the logo with their cursor. I’m happy with how it turned out. </p>

<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<p>For the second phase, the beta, we had to up the complexity factor. Since I couldn’t really think of how to significantly add complexity to the logo, I decided to create a new micro-interaction from scratch. I wanted to still focus on improving my site, so I looked to other areas that I could improve. I then settled on my art gallery page of images, which was very static. I decided that my interaction would involve the image bouncing up and down when the user hovered over it, and then when clicked, would display the title of the piece and the mediums used. Below is a GIF of what I wanted to achieve in the build. I had again used After Effects to render out this scene. </p>

<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<p>I added a CSS webkit animation using the swing parameter, which would be triggered by a hover selector via the image. To create the desired effect of the text fading in/out on a click over the image, I utilized code from Codepen.io as a reference. I built it out in my site so that the text box sat in a div atop the image. Clicking would trigger a JavaScript event that would change the text div’s visibility from being hidden to showing. I then added some timing on the transition to make the text fade smooth. I thought it looked pretty great. </p>

<br>
<br>
<br>
<p>With the two initial project phases complete, I looked to building out the final phase. I concluded that the project would yield the best results if I built further on the beta phase. </p>

<h2>The Final </h2>

<p>For my final project, I had fully realized my vision that began with my initial design and build of my alpha phase. To make my website more pleasing to use, and to add features in the functional interactions to give it the character that my creativity exudes. Below is my final project which can be interacted with right on this page. </p>

      <br>
<p>As stated, I had built off the beta micro-interaction phase, as I thought that sufficient complexity could be added to make a complete final project. Upon expanding on the image bounce animation on hover, I added a wobbly jump sound effect which would play as well. This was triggered by a JavaScript function. For the appearing text div, I added an additional page of clickable text, and a clickable close button. To accomplish this, I created three divs, one which contained the close button, and the other two containing the pages of text. They were all scaled atop the image div to achieve the overlay effect, and their visibility would be cycled on click. An error I had come across when building out my final was the sound effect not playing on hover. This had to do with the web security standard of browsers not allowing sounds to play until the user interacts with the page. To overcome this, I designed an “enable sound” button, and matched the color to the image for a cohesive experience.

  <h2>The Results</h2>
  
  <p>I would consider the micro-interactions that I had built out to be a success. I had received positive feedback from the twelve friends and family throughout my iterations of the alpha, beta, and final phases. I had received great grades on all the phases of the project as well. But most importantly, my final project is meaningful. I am proud of how it turned out, and I truly believe that it will enhance my portfolio– I can certainly say that I am confident in showcasing this project. I plan to add my built-out micro-interactions onto my portfolio website, and most likely find other areas of my website that I can add similar spice to. If I had more time to take this project further, I would like to add a feature where the image also gets larger on click, so that the user can get a better look at the image while reading the text. I would also like to add a little eye icon that would allow the user to open the image in a large size/full screen. I will most likely build these out in the future. I think one area I could improve on was giving myself more time for building out the interactions, as it would have made troubleshooting less stressful. Some additional takeaways I found was in my use of resources such as Stack Overflow and Codepen.io, to find segments of pre-existing code. Not only did it allow me to build out the framework of my project, but it also brought me deeper into the community of coding. </p>

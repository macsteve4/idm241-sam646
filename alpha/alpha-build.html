                  <h3>Alpha Build Description...</h3>
                  <p class="about">Below, I will detail the triggers, rules, feedback, loops and modes, as well as providing a link to my website which contains the current logo.
                    <br>
                                      <br>
                                      <b>Triggers</b> - Hovering the mouse cursor over the button/logo will activate the microinteraction.
                    <br>
                                      <br>
                                      <b>Rules</b> - When hovered over, it will toggle an event where the static .png is swapped with a moving .gif and then swapped back when the hover ceases. The mouse cursor will also change to a finger pointer.
                    <br>
                                      <br>
                                      <b>Feedback</b> - While hovering over the logo with the cursor, the user will see the visual elements of the icon move around as if the pencil is “drawing” on the paper. The pencil (yellow element) will move left and right and rotate clockwise slightly along its bottom left point. The paper (white and black element) will slightly rotate counter-clockwise along its center, in order to easily make contact with the pencil element. The blob (purple element) will also lose its drop-shadow. After a few movements of the pencil on the paper, both elements will return to their original positions, and then repeat the motions again. The user will also see the mouse cursor change to a finger pointer on hover.
                    <br>
                                      <br>
                                      <b>Loops</b> - The GIF animation of pencil and paper rotating/moving will play on repeat continuously whilst the mouse cursor is hovering over the logo.
                    <br>
                                      <br>
                                      <b>Modes</b> - There are no modes, as no additional information will pop up while the logo is being hovered over.
                    <br>
                                      <br>

                    <br>
                    I plan to add a bounce effect on hover and a title and description will pop-up when the images are clicked.</p>

                  <p class="about">Below, I will detail the triggers, rules, feedback, loops and modes.
                    <br>
                                      <br>
                                      <b>Triggers</b> - Hovering the mouse cursor over the image, clicking the image.
                    <br>
                                      <br>
                                      <b>Rules</b> - When hovered over, the image will bounce up and down in place. The cursor will also change from the pointer to the finger state. Then, when clicked, a white title and description will fade in over the image. A black overlay, (which has the dimensions of the image) at 0.6 opacity will also fade over on click, at the same time as the text. Once the image is clicked again, the title, description, and overlay will fade back out.
                    <br>
                                      <br>
                                      <b>Feedback</b> - The user will see the same things that are listed in Rules.
                    <br>
                                      <br>
                                      <b>Loops</b> - No loops in this microinteraction.
                    <br>
                                      <br>
                                      <b>Modes</b> - When the image is clicked, additional information appears (the title and description).
                    <br>

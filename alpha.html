          <h3>An Interactive Logo...</h3>
              <div class="aboutflex">
                <div class="opener">
                  <p class="top">My personal website's logo is a great representation of my artistic roots. I also use it as a linked element to bring viewers back to the homepage. 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    But, one area that it suffers in is the lack of interactivity when it's either hovered over, or clicked. Here is a GIF of what I want to happen:</p>
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  <br>
                </div>
                <div class="pic">
                  <picture>
                    <img class= "me" src= "imagesscaled/alphagif.gif" alt="GIF image of the new logo, moving when hovered over and bouncing when clicked.">
                  </picture>
                </div>
              </div>
                  <br> 
                  <h3>Alpha Description...</h3>
                  <p class="about">Below, I will detail the triggers, rules, feedback, loops and modes, as well as providing a link to my website which contains the current logo.
                    <br>
                                      <br>
                                      <b>Triggers</b> - Hovering the mouse cursor over the button/logo, left-clicking on the logo with the mouse cursor, will activate the microinteraction.
                    <br>
                                      <br>
                                      <b>Rules</b> - When the cursor is hovered over the logo, it will toggle an event where the logo’s .png image is replaced with a .GIF image in the same position. Then, when the logo is clicked, it will toggle another event where a darkened .png image of the stationary logo will replace the GIF in the same position, while also linking/directing to my site’s index page.
                    <br>
                                      <br>
                                      <b>Feedback</b> - While hovering over the logo with the cursor, the user will see the visual elements of the icon move around as if the pencil is “drawing” on the paper. The pencil (yellow element) will move left and right and rotate clockwise slightly along its bottom left point. The paper (white and black element) will slightly rotate counter-clockwise along its center, in order to easily make contact with the pencil element. After a few movements of the pencil on the paper, both elements will return to their original positions, and then repeat the motions again.
                                      <br>
                                      <br>
                                      When clicking the logo with their cursor, the user will see the logo return to the stationary image and darken as they are redirected to the homepage.
                    <br>
                                      <br>
                                      <b>Loops</b> - The GIF animation of pencil and paper rotating/moving will play on repeat continuously whilst the mouse cursor is hovering over the logo.
                    <br>
                                      <br>
                                      <b>Modes</b> - There are no modes in this microinteraction, as no additional information/windows will pop up while the logo is being hovered over or clicked.
                    <br>
                                      <br>
                                      <b>Link</b> to my site showing the stiffness of the old logo: <a href="https://mcinerneymedia.com/uiux.html">https://mcinerneymedia.com/uiux.html</a>
